## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Implementation Details

### Image Quality Analysis Algorithm

```typescript
// Brightness calculation (luminance-based)
brightness = 0.299 * R + 0.587 * G + 0.114 * B

// Contrast calculation (standard deviation)
contrast = sqrt(Œ£(luminance - avgLuminance)¬≤ / pixelCount)

// Sharpness calculation (Sobel edge detection)
sharpness = sqrt(gx¬≤ + gy¬≤) where gx, gy are gradient vectors
```

### Camera Enhancement Features

```typescript
// Enhanced constraints for high-quality capture
const constraints = {
  video: {
    facingMode: 'environment',
    width: { ideal: 1920, max: 1920 },
    height: { ideal: 1080, max: 1080 },
    frameRate: { ideal: 30, max: 60 },
    focusMode: 'continuous',
    whiteBalanceMode: 'auto',
    exposureMode: 'continuous',
  }
};
```

### Quality Assessment Integration

```typescript
// Client-side quality analysis before API call
const qualityMetrics = ImageAnalysisUtils.analyzeImageQuality(canvas);

// Provide immediate feedback to user
if (qualityMetrics.quality === 'poor') {
  toast.error('Consider retaking for better results');
}
```
